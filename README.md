Gamified Environmental Awareness – VR Project
An interactive VR-based gamified learning platform designed to promote environmental awareness by allowing users to explore and interact with virtual recyclable and non-recyclable materials in an immersive 3D environment.
This project uses 3D models, game mechanics, and interactive scenes to educate users about waste management, recycling, and sustainability in an engaging way.
Project Objective

To make environmental education fun, immersive, and memorable by using:
Virtual Reality (VR)
Gamification techniques
Users learn by seeing, interacting, and making choices, rather than reading static content.

Key Features:
Interactive 3D Environment
Plastic, metal and waste objects as 3D models
Game-based learning approach
Educational decision-making
VR compatible design
.glb 3D models integrated
Promotes recycling and environmental responsibility
